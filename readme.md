# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ .NET 8

Want to try out the latest performance improvements coming with .NET 8 for web development? 

This repo builds a Weather API using Minimal APIs, opens Swagger so you can call and test the API, and displays the data in a web application using Blazor with .NET 8. 

We've given you both a frontend and backend to play around with and where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.
